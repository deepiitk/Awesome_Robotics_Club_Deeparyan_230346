 In my school days, I used to explore project ideas by watching YouTube videos. I came across videos about robotic arms and was deeply fascinated by the concept. However, due to a lack of resources and guidance, I wasn't able to pursue this project. In my first year, I wast not able to actively participate in robotics club sessions, but I am eager to change that. I believe participating in this project would offer me valuable learning opportunities.

I also want to confess that I sought help from a friend. However, it wasn't a case where my friend completed the tasks for me. Rather, we discussed how to approach the project after studying relevant topics together. This robotic arm project is the one I am truly passionate about, and I haven't submitted or worked on any other projects.
